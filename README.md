# UFOs
## Overview

The purpose of this challenge is to take a base html web site and apply a javascript script to the html that allows the user to filter by different criteria.

## Results

When a user comes to the website, they are displayed a screen that has an introduction paragraph to the site as well as the title. When the user scrolls down on the page there is a list of reported UFO sightings. These sightings can be filter on the left side of the page with different criteria. They can choose between data, state, shape, country, and city. When the user inputs their search into a text field and hits enter the page goes through the data and only shows sightings with those criteria. To clear search the user can reload the page by click UFO sightings at the top of the page or they can clear each field manually.

## Summary

One draw back to this system is that the file that has the data for sightings is static meaning it does not get updated with new sightings as they come in. potentially could do some work with APIs to get a list that is always up to date and not static. One other further development that could be down is move the sightings to a separate page and leave the home page as a general information-based page with information on UFO sightings. Potentially could add a keyword search as well to search for specific sightings with certain keywords in the comments.
